    <h2>Why I’m Running</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <strong>Michael Kissi</strong>, and I’m running for School President because I believe I
      have a level of great leadership skills to lead us to greater heights.
      Leadership is not just about giving instructions—it’s about listening,
      representing, and working together as one school community.
    </p>

    <h2>My Plans for You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Student Council Committee</strong> – I plan to make a Student Council Committee where meetings are held at the end of every month to discuss the problems of students and how we can go about solving them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Memorable Events</strong> – We would hold unforgettable events like art and science exhibitions, sports tournaments, fun competitions, and cultural days to bring excitement and pride into our school life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support and Success</strong> – I will encourage peer tutoring, study groups, and extra activities that help us excel academically while building confidence and teamwork.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recognition for Achievements</strong> – I will work on more ways to celebrate not just academic success, but also achievements in sports, arts, leadership, and service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Student Well-being</strong> – I’ll push for activities that reduce stress, promote positivity, and make school a place where we all feel safe, supported, and motivated.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <div class="closing">
    <p>
      I believe that with your trust and support, we can create a school that is fun, inspiring, and united—one where every student feels proud to belong.  
      <br /><br />
      So when it’s time to vote, remember: <strong>Your voice. Your choice. Our future.</strong>
